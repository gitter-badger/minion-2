# Neueda Minion (HipChat bot)

Standard bot extensions:

* `sfx: <name>`: bot will play a sound effect (e.g. "applause", "evil", "gong", "rimshot", "trombone").
* `good news: <your news here>`: bot will broadcast a notification to all rooms he's in.

You can type these commands to the bot in rooms it's in or privately.
